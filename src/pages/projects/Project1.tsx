                    This project marks my intentional initiation into web programming. The concept was conceived immediately after completing <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/" target="_blank">Codecademy</a>'s <span className="is-italic">Learn Intermediate JavaScript</span> course. As I mapped out my path to becoming a <span className="has-text-weight-bold">Full-Stack Developer</span>, I deliberately chose to build this simple web application using <span className="has-text-weight-bold">vanilla JavaScript</span>. My goal was to establish a foundational understanding, which I plan to later use to compare and contrast the developer experience when utilizing modern tools like <span className="has-text-weight-bold">React</span> and <span className="has-text-weight-bold">TypeScript</span>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Though simple, this foundational project was invaluable. It provided essential, hands-on lessons in <span className="has-text-weight-bold">state management</span>, <span className="has-text-weight-bold">API data fetching</span>, <span className="has-text-weight-bold">DOM manipulation</span>, and <span className="has-text-weight-bold">robust error handling</span>. These concepts remain cornerstones of my daily development practice and solidified my resolve to pursue this career path.
